Choose Your Own Adventure!
------------------------
----------------
The object of the game is to choose a path that you find best to take you onto the next stage. After you pick a path an event will pop up explaining the consequences of your decision. Not all paths will lead you forward some will kill your player, damage him greatly, or lead you in the wrong direction. You can find weapons and supplies that will help you along the way with paths.

Each stage you continue onto will reward you with 5 points to your score, and if you hit certain milestones you will be rewarded more points. After your player 1 dies, player 2 will start from the begginning. Once both players die, the winner will be determined base off who has the most points.
